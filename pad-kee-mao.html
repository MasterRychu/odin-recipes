    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pad Kee Mao is a Thai dish that translates to <em>Drunken Stir Fry</em> in
      English. The drunken description comes from the fact that it originated in
      late-night revelers' kitchens after stumbling home from nightclubs at
      dawn.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ½ ounces dried Thai-style rice noodles</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
      <li>½ pound pork, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 serrano pepper, minced or more to taste</li>
      <li>30 fresh chopped basil leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup of bean sprouts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and let soak
        until white and softened, about 1 hour. Drain noodles, and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat 1 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil in a wok or large skillet over low
        heat, and cook and stir 2 minced garlic cloves until brown and beginning
        to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir in the soaked noodles, 1/2 teaspoon of thick soy sauce, and 2
        teaspoons of sugar, and cook and stir until the noodles have absorbed
        the soy sauce and turned brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the noodles from
        the skillet.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil in the wok over low
        heat; stir in the remaining 2 minced garlic cloves, and cook until brown
        and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high,
        and stir in the pork, serrano pepper, basil, 1/2 teaspoon thick soy
        sauce, 1 teaspoon sugar, and salt. Cook and stir until the pork is no
        longer pink and the edges of the meat are beginning to brown, about 5
        minutes. Return the noodles to the wok, and stir in the bean sprouts.
        Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 more minutes.
